    <p>A bit of explanation:
    <ul>
      <li>What's on video is frequencies (spectrum), lower frequencies shown lower.</li>
      <li>Blue part is the <i>preview</i> (seeing frequencies as they are played
        seem to be very "sudden" to perceive).</li>
      <li>Frequencies are normalized - so if you see the voice part "take over" and engine/music/other sounds fade
        away
        that's because voice part is more significant and normalization makes other sounds fade.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions and answers</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>The simplest?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I can probably write it in about 30 lines of quite simple Python (no dependencies) &ndash; it's that simple.
        </p>

        <p>It's so simple that sometimes I think it could be found with brute force of simplest algorithms over an
          input.
          But that's just an author's bias, of course: I had to go through a couple hundred non-working ones over months
          to find this one.</p>

        <p>It's not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">Fourier</a> (Wow, I compete with
          Fourier!) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_transform">Gabor transform"</a> (for the same reason).</p>

        <p><s>It's extremely lightweight &ndash; I can produce a spectrum using less than 10 * <a href="#"
            data-toggle="tooltip" title="N denotes number of samples, F - number of frequencies">N * F</a>
          <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip"
            title="additions, multiplications, sqrt, log, arctan and the like">operations</a> <i>overall</i>.
          It's highly likely that I have invented the most efficient/lightweight spectrum algorithm <u>ever</u>!</s><br />
        It is very lightweight, but {the current edition} is comparable to FFT.
      </p>

        <p>It's also conceptually the simplest. I think I could convey the idea in <b>5</b> sentences
          to anyone who passed <a href="https://g.co/codejam">codejam</a>'s round 1 (or, maybe, round 2).
          A4 sheet of information would be enough for a 14 year old (probably, a bit math inclined).
        </p>

      </dd>

      <dt>More on comparison with FFT</dt>
      <dd>Fourier transform works perfectly on a periodic signal.
        In order to be applied to sound, a 'sliding window trick' is used.
        Moreover: as a random window doesn't perfectly match at ends, another 'smoothing' must be used. <br />
        Pick a window too wide, and you're likely to lose high frequencies.
        Pick a window too narrow, and you're restricted from analyzing low frequencies. <br />

        All this suggests that there's a better way. <br />

        Please compare analysis of modem handshake sound: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvr9AMWEU-c">FFT</a>
        vs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMEFxu82Po0">mine</a>.<br />
        Or this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FatxGN3vAM">FFT</a> vs <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeaVkoZe-0M">mine</a>.<br />

        Or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/102126787983868/videos/546199572647609/">violin sound decomposed</a>.
        <br />

        Facebook's <a href="https://research.fb.com/downloads/wav2letter/">wav2letter</a> uses <a
          href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03193.pdf">25 ms sliding window and 10 ms stride</a>.
        I simply don't need this. <br />

        While technically FFT can be computed <i>O(N&middot;logN)</i> at best, given that the sliding window's length is
        fixed,
        that's <i>O(N)</i> time complexity to process the signal.
        However, in practice my method would need <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="not 1000-10000 as I thought before">10-100</a>
        times less operations to build a spectrogram.

      </dd>

      <dt>More on comparison with ...</dt>
      <dd>I tried searching the web for existing solution. What I have is far from
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_spectrum">log power spectrum</a> or
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum">Mel-frequency cepstrum</a> or
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_predictive_coding">linear predictive coding</a>
        (which is a bit obvious after the statement on simplicity, but I'm constantly asked about this).
      </dd>

      <dt>Possible applications</dt>
      <dd>The algorithm can largely improve the quality of home speakers and online speech-to-text services.
        It can largely save battery on phones (especially for hot phrase detection)
        and even enable speech recognition on watches and earbuds!
        <br />

        It's certainly useful for all kinds of signal processing. E.g. real time software-defined radios could raise
        their limits.
      </dd>

      <!-- <dt>Prospects</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Plan A. Cooperate with a Fortune 500 company; potentially patent the algorithm (which is questionable given
          the simplicity);
          grant license for 5 years.</p>
        <p>Plan B. Proceed with creating a speech-to-text service.</p>
      </dd> -->

      <dt>Can I try it?</dt>
      <!-- <dd>No. I used to publish a web service, but it didn't receive much attention. E-mail me if you're interested.</dd> -->
      <dd><a href="https://github.com/bohdantrotsenko/spectrum">Yes (questions are welcome).</a></dd>
